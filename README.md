# Trading-Simulator

Hello, welcome to the first program that I built! Please leave your comments after you use my program.

This program will help you buy and sell American stocks virtually. You can see the real time price change information and you will be able to use this trading simulator to try your intraday trading strategies. 

Moreover, this trading program also incorporates the use of twitter streaming API and Google Natrual Language Cloud API. By using twitter streaming API, you will be able to get real time live tweets about certain information that you are interested. Then by applying Google Natural Language Could API, the saved real time tweets will be analyzed and you will be able to tell whether the tweets are positive or negative. The goal of using these two APIs in this trading simulator is to give user an analytics tool to obtain the market sentiment related to a certain stock

The next step related to this program is to develop a web interface which will allow anyone to get access to it(now you can only see and use the program if you have a python compiler)

# Instructions on how to use the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIAL

When you fork "Simulator.py" or download to your own python compiler, you need to set the environmental variable of the document which you just download by adding the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIAL there and typing out the path of the credential file. You need both the "Simulaor" and the "GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIAL" file in your working directory to successfully launch this program!
